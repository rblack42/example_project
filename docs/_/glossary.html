<dt id="term-assembly-language">Assembly Language</dt>
<dd>A human readable form of <a class="reference internal" href="#term-machine-language"><em class="xref std std-term">machine language</em></a>. An <a class="reference internal" href="#term-assembler"><em class="xref std std-term">assembler</em></a>
converts code written in this language into <a class="reference internal" href="#term-machine-language"><em class="xref std std-term">machine language</em></a>.
These languages are processor specific.</dd>
<dt id="term-avatar">Avatar</dt>
<dd>A graphical representation of a user. Often an image, but it can be a
cartoon-like character as well. To make the web more personal (and less
anonymous), sites like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a> help users show their chosen avatar on
many web sites. I consider this usage part of setting up a

<dt id="term-baby-step"><span id="term-baby-steps"></span>Baby Step<br />Baby Steps</dt>
<dd>A software development process that focuses on making very small
changes to your code, followed by a quick test using the compiler to
make sure you can run your code, and a run that generates output you
can inspect to see how your changes are working. The key to this is
doing this sequence often.</dd>
<dt id="term-blasting-code"><span id="term-blast-code"></span>Blasting Code<br />Blast Code</dt>
<dd>An <a class="reference internal" href="#term-old-school"><em class="xref std std-term">old school</em></a> method of software development. This method
involves long sessions of writing code with few attempts to test the
code. The result is often long sessions fixing typing mistakes,
followed by long sessions with a debugger trying to figure out why
things do not work.</dd>
<dt id="term-branch"><span id="term-branches"></span>Branch<br />Branches</dt>
<dd>A fork in the development road where a new feature is developed

where the file is stored.</dd>
<dt id="term-change-script"><span id="term-change-scripts"></span>Change Script<br />Change Scripts</dt>
<dd>This is a chunk of code that can be used by an appropriate tool to
convert one product into another one. These scripts are the heart of
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-source-code-control-systems"><em class="xref std std-term">source code control systems</em></a>. The Unix tool <strong class="program">diff</strong> is
used to create such scripts.</dd>
<dt id="term-clone">Clone</dt>
<dd>Create a copy of files living on a remote server for your local use.
This creates a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-working-copy"><em class="xref std std-term">working copy</em></a> of the project. You may (or may
not) have rights to make changes and <a class="reference internal" href="#term-push"><em class="xref std std-term">push</em></a> them back up. It is
common to <a class="reference internal" href="#term-clone"><em class="xref std std-term">clone</em></a> project hosted on services like GitHub so you
can use the code or study it. You can update your local copy at any
time to keep up with changes in the project.</dd>
<dt id="term-code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</dt>
<dd>Every profession has a defined set of rules they expect members of that
profession to follow. Most of the time, these rules are common sense,
but they are defined to make sure every member understands what the
profession seeks to present itself to the public. You are expected to
know these rules and follow them when you join the profession. Look
into each profession&#8217;s primary organization for guidance. For computer
folks, this is probably the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.acm.org">Association for Computing Machinery</a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-command">Command</dt>
<dd>A series of space-separated text items handed to the operating system.
The first of these items is the name of some program (which may be
internal to the operating system) you want to run. The rest of the
items are called <a class="reference internal" href="#term-parameters"><em class="xref std std-term">parameters</em></a> which are processed by the program
and control exactly what that program does.</dd>
<dt id="term-command-line">Command Line</dt>
<dd>A simple text line on your screen where you can type in a
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-command"><em class="xref std std-term">command</em></a> to the operating system.</dd>
<dt id="term-comment"><span id="term-comments"></span>Comment<br />Comments</dt>
<dd>Short chunks of text added to program code that seeks to explain when
is going on. Far too often, this text just repeats what the code
actually says, making them useless. Comments should explain the &#8220;why&#8221; of
a block of code.</dd>
<dt id="term-commit"><span id="term-commits"></span>Commit<br />Commits</dt>
<dd><a class="reference internal" href="#term-push"><em class="xref std std-term">push</em></a> to a remote server.</dd>
<dt id="term-72"><span id="term-73"></span>Commit<br />Commits</dt>
<dd>The process of generating a marker that records the state of a project
at that moment in time. <a class="reference internal" href="#term-sccs"><em class="xref std std-term">SCCS</em></a> systems generate a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-change-script"><em class="xref std std-term">change
script</em></a> that can be used to restore your project to the exact form is
has at this moment, even as the project continues on in its
development.</dd>
<dt id="term-compile"><span id="term-compiler"></span><span id="term-compilers"></span>Compile<br />Compiler<br />Compilers</dt>
<dd>When we process a program written in a high-level programming language,
the tool we use is called a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-compiler"><em class="xref std std-term">compiler</em></a>. That tool converts our
program into the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-machine-language"><em class="xref std std-term">machine language</em></a> the processor actually
understands.. We say we <a class="reference internal" href="#term-compile"><em class="xref std std-term">compile</em></a> our programs.</dd>
<dt id="term-conflict"><span id="term-conflicts"></span>Conflict<br />Conflicts</dt>
<dd>A situation where two different versions of a single project asset
exist. The differences must be resolved before the asset can continue
to exist in the combined project.</dd>
<dt id="term-74">Content Addressable File System</dt>
<dd>A system that stores objects with names based on the contents of those
objects. Used by <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> internally to store version information.</dd>
<dt id="term-context-free">Context Free</dt>
<dd>A programming language must be defined in such a way that figuring out
what should come next (<a class="reference internal" href="#term-tokens"><em class="xref std std-term">tokens</em></a>) can be figured out without
studying the context in which the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-token"><em class="xref std std-term">token</em></a> appears.</dd>
<dt id="term-context-menu">Context Menu</dt>
<dd>On most systems, when you <tt class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">right-click</span></tt> on something, you bring up
a menu that is sensitive to the context of the thing you are pointing
to. That menu lets you perform tasks common to that thing!</dd>
<dt id="term-continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</dt>
<dd>A testing technique where a project is automatically tested on a number
of build systems to verify that the project is running properly. By
testing automatically, developers can spot major problems that cause
errors on specific platforms quickly.</dd>
<dt id="term-cookie">Cookie</dt>
<dd>A small file containing information needed to reconnect you to a web
server automatically. Cookies often store log in credentials. It is
vital that you never allow your personal cookies to be saved on a
public machine. Doing so gives others complete access to your accounts.
Parameter Parameters A block of text (no spaces allowed, unless the
block is enclosed in quotes) that is passed to a program or a
sub-program. If passed to a program and there are more than one
parameter needed, they are usually separated by spaces. If passed to a
sub-program, they are usually separated by commas.</dd>
<dt id="term-current">Current</dt>
<dd>This is the flow of electrons through a circuit. Moving electrons
generate heat and electromagnetic waves as a by-product of this motion.</dd>
<dt id="term-data-alignment">Data Alignment</dt>
<dd>Modern processors work best when data is aligned so that the data item
fits in a natural data chunk the processor will fetch. Misalignment
problems occur when a single data item requires two memory accesses to
access.</dd>
<dt id="term-ddns"><span id="term-dyndns"></span><span id="term-dynamic-dns"></span>DDNS<br />DynDNS<br />Dynamic DNS</dt>
<dd>A service that updates <a class="reference internal" href="#term-dns"><em class="xref std std-term">DNS</em></a> tables used by Internet services to
map domain names to addresses. These services are helpful if your
network address changes often, as it might if you are working from home
and want to set up a server.</dd>
<dt id="term-debugger">Debugger</dt>
<dd>A software development tool that is used to step a program one line at
a time, then allows the developer to inspect the internal state of the
machine as the program runs. They are a vital, and often under-used
tool in programming.</dd>
<dt id="term-decode">Decode</dt>
<dd>After the processor has <a class="reference internal" href="#term-fetched"><em class="xref std std-term">fetched</em></a> part of an instruction, it
decodes that part to determine what additional information it needs to
do its work. If it needs more data from memory, that data will be read
from memory into internal registers. As part of this step, the complete
size of the instruction is calculated, and the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-ip"><em class="xref std std-term">IP</em></a> register is
updated to point to the next instruction in memory.</dd>
<dt id="term-diff"><span id="term-difference"></span>Diff<br />Difference</dt>
<dd>A tool can read two files and show the differences between them. It can
also create a <cite>patch</cite> file that can be used to convert one of them into
the other.</dd>
<dt id="term-directory"><span id="term-directory-tree"></span>Directory<br />Directory Tree</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The <a class="reference internal" href="#term-operating-system"><em class="xref std std-term">operating system</em></a> on most computers, today, uses tree-like
structure to store files.  The top of this tree, called the root of the
tree, is a directory (or folder as Microsoft want us to call it). The
name of this directory is either &#8220;/&#8221; on a Linux/Mac system, or &#8220;&#8221; on a
Windows system.</p>
<p class="last">A Directory is a container that can hold either files (objects that
contain only data, such as text, images, of other binary data) or other
directory objects (called subdirectories). Subdirectories have names
that follow the rules for the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-operating-system"><em class="xref std std-term">operating system</em></a>.  Any directory
or subdirectory can hold files of further subdirectories, giving the
entire file system a (upside down) tree-like structure.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-dns"><span id="term-domain-name-service"></span>DNS<br />Domain Name Service</dt>
<dd>A phone book like service that maps domain names, like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">www.pylit.org</span></tt>,
to an IP address.</dd>
<dt id="term-domain-name">Domain Name</dt>
<dd>Servers on the Internet are all part of some registered domain, which
has a name associated with it. I own <cite>pylit.org</cite> for example. The last
part is used to brand the kind of domain I am part of, in this case a
non-profit organization. The first part is often chosen to identify the
company involved. You can add a machine name to the front of this
name. Often <cite>www</cite> is tacked on to identify a web server where the
companies website is found.</dd>
<dt id="term-dotfiles">DotFiles</dt>
<dd>Many programs keep settings in a hidden file in the user&#8217;s <a class="reference internal" href="#term-home-directory"><em class="xref std std-term">home
directory</em></a>. Exactly what these file hold depends on the program. It is
common to manage these files in some way. I keep mine on my <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
account at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rblack42/dotfiles">https://github.com/rblack42/dotfiles</a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-drag-and-drop">Drag and Drop</dt>
<dd>A modern method of constructing programs, or executing commands by

<dd>A notation used to define the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-135"><em class="xref std std-term">syntax</em></a> of a programming language.
The notation is designed to be <a class="reference internal" href="#term-context-free"><em class="xref std std-term">context free</em></a> meaning there are no
places where figuring out what comes next in a program depends on the
context of the program. Usually, the rules can tell what is coming next
by simple looking at the next <a class="reference internal" href="#term-token"><em class="xref std std-term">token</em></a> in the program</dd>
<dt id="term-environment-variable"><span id="term-environment-variables"></span>Environment Variable<br />Environment Variables</dt>

<dd>In spite of the negative connotations of the term, we say a computer
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-executes"><em class="xref std std-term">executes</em></a> a program. The program that can be run is called
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-executable"><em class="xref std std-term">executable</em></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-179"><span id="term-execution"></span>Execute<br />Execution</dt>
<dd>We call the act of actually processing something in a computer
<cite>executing</cite> that something. The something can be a single
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-machine-instruction"><em class="xref std std-term">Machine Instruction</em></a>, or a complete program. We are a brutal
race of beings, aren&#8217;t we?</dd>
<dt id="term-fetch"><span id="term-fetched"></span>Fetch<br />Fetched</dt>
<dd>Using a special register called an <a class="reference internal" href="#term-instruction-pointer"><em class="xref std std-term">Instruction Pointer</em></a> (or
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-ip"><em class="xref std std-term">IP</em></a>, the processor reaches into the system memory at the address
designated by the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-ip"><em class="xref std std-term">IP</em></a> register and fetches a defined number of
bytes which form all or part of the next <a class="reference internal" href="#term-machine-instruction"><em class="xref std std-term">Machine Instruction</em></a> to
be processed.</dd>
<dt id="term-finite-state-machine">Finite State Machine</dt>
<dd>A system whose operation is defined as a set of <a class="reference internal" href="#term-states"><em class="xref std std-term">states</em></a> and
transitions from one <a class="reference internal" href="#term-state"><em class="xref std std-term">state</em></a> to the next.</dd>
<dt id="term-flow-chart">Flow Chart</dt>
<dd>A form of diagram showing the logic of a program. These diagrams have
been around for almost as long as computers have been available. They
are a great way (but not the only way) to visualize how your program
will &#8220;flow&#8221; and think about what will happen when you run the program.</dd>
<dt id="term-gravatar">Gravatar</dt>
<dd>A service that will provide your image when you log into a number of
web sites. That image can be viewed by others to make sure they
recognize the you they are communicating with. I consider using such a
service part of setting up a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-professional-image"><em class="xref std std-term">professional image</em></a>.</dd>

to all of the content of some object. These strings are often used to
detect if the object has been altered in any way.</dd>
<dt id="term-hidden-file">Hidden File</dt>
<dd>Most operating systems &#8220;hide&#8221; file names that start with a dot &#8221;.&#8221;.
These normally contain configuration information that should not be
modified unless you know what you are doing You need to use a special
command to display these files when generating a directory list.</dd>

<dt id="term-high-level-language">High-Level Language</dt>
<dd>Most programming languages are designed to help humans instruct a
machine in how to solve some problem. These languages do not care what
processor they will run on, and are called <cite>machine independent</cite>.  You
use a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-compiler"><em class="xref std std-term">compiler</em></a> designed to convert your high-level code into
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-machine-language"><em class="xref std std-term">machine language</em></a> for a particular processor. Different

<dt id="term-home-directory">Home Directory</dt>
<dd>Most operating systems create a directory you are to use for all of
your files on that system. This directory is tied to the user account
you log into when you access that system. On Windows, this is the
directory where your &#8220;My Documents&#8221; folder is found, usually a place
like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\Users\username</span></tt>. On Linux systems the directory will be in

<dd>Processors normally run programs using a simple four step process
called &#8220;Fetch-Decode-Execute-Store&#8221;. When the machine is at the point
where it is about to fetch another <a class="reference internal" href="#term-instruction"><em class="xref std std-term">instruction</em></a>, a signal can
stop the action, and cause the machine to jump to a block of code that
handles the signal. The signal is called an interrupt, since it
interrupts the normal flow of a program. The code that deals with the
signal is called an <a class="reference internal" href="#term-interrupt-handler"><em class="xref std std-term">Interrupt Handler</em></a>. Hopefully,
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-interrupts"><em class="xref std std-term">interrupts</em></a> are short enough that the interrupted program does
